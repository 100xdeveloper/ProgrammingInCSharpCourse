## ToDo
1. Write a program in C# to display the first 10 natural numbers
2. Write a C# program to find the sum of first 20 odd natural numbers.
3. Write a program in C# to read 5 numbers from keyboard and find their sum and average.
4. Write a program in C# to display the **multiplication table** vertically from *1 to n*. \
Test Data: \
Input upto the table number starting from 1 : 8 \
Expected Output:\
Multiplication table from 1 to 8 \
1x1 = 1, 2x1 = 2, 3x1 = 3, 4x1 = 4, 5x1 = 5, 6x1 = 6, 7x1 = 7, 8x1 = 8 \
... \
1x10 = 10, 2x10 = 20, 3x10 = 30, 4x10 = 40, 5x10 = 50, 6x10 = 60, 7x10 = 70, 8x10 = 80
5. Write a program in C# to display the pattern like right angle triangle using an asterisk. 
The pattern like :

	\* \
	\*\* \
	\*\*\* \
	\*\*\*\* \
	\*\*\*\*\*

6. Write a program in C# to make such a pattern like right angle triangle with number increased by 1. 
The pattern like : \
	1\
	2 3\
	4 5 6\
	7 8 9 10
7. Write a program in C# to display the sum of the series [ 9 + 99 + 999 + 9999 ...]. 
Test Data :\
Input the number or terms :5\
Expected Output :\
9 99 999 9999 99999 \
The sum of the series = 111105
8. Write a C# program to find prime numbers up to users entered value. \
   Exmpl: input-100, Result: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 ... 89, 97
9.  Write a program in C# to check whether a number can be express as sum of two prime numbers. \
Test Data :\
Input a positive integer: 16\
Expected Output :\
16 = 3 + 13\
16 = 5 + 11
1.  Write a program in C# to check whether a number is a palindrome (**visual simmetric**) or not. 
Test Data :\
Input a number: 121\
Expected Output :\
121 is a palindrome number.
