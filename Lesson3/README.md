## ToDo
1. Write a C# program that takes two numbers as input and returns true or false when both numbers are even or odd
2. Write a C# program which takes 2 string input from user and return if second string is in first string.
	Example. 1st input: Azərbaycan, 2nd input: can, Result should be true because **can** is in **Azərbaycan**
3. Get 2 int number input from user and calculate the exact **input1 / input2**. Example: 16, 5. Result shoul be 3.2 not 3.
4. Practise type conversions (different options), types and operators
